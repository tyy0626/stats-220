## Analysis for daily observations on bus trip

We can see that the mean value for people wearing headphones is about 4 and the max is 9. The first bar chart shows the crowded condition during the week. The second bar chart shows the distribution of the weather condition during the week. 

```{r}
paste("The mean value is", mean_value, "and the max value is", max_value)
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = weather)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of weather", 
       x = "weather", 
       y = "num")
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = bus_crowd)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of bus crowded level", 
       x = "crowded condition", 
       y = "num")
```
